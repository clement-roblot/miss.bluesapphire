	<p>	I love to draw since i was a little girl, this is what i found that i can do it all my life ,i'm also a bookworm so most of my drawing come from mixing things that i have read and experienced, i called it 'Weirdoland'. I have a passion of fairytale and i love the idea of drawing somthing science in a fancy version moreover i love monsters and weird things so most of my works are about fantasy that tell a story in my strange mind.
